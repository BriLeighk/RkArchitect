            Can homes be designed & built to withstand Extreme Wildfires? What about the Massive Fire Tornadoes that swirl and carry debris with hurricane force winds?
          </p>
          <p>
            Fire tornadoes are real, extremely powerful and are becoming enormous. A recent terrifying Fire Tornado in California was so powerful it killed a 17 year veteran firefighter, Jeremy Stoke, and wiped out every building in it’s path. This Fire Tornado was 1000 feet across (more than 3 football fields), extended 7.5 miles high with hurling winds & debris up to 165 mph, equivalent to a Category 5 Hurricane, and was unstoppable. Authorities anticipate that temperatures inside this Fire Tornado exceeded 2,700 degrees F. What would it take to design and build a structure to withstand this kind of natural phenomenon?

                If this video terrifies you, it should, especially if you live in a house built with wood frame construction, which is the standard method of construction in many states currently experiencing extreme wildfires.

          <p>
            Houses built with wood framing essentially provide a tremendous amount of fuel that wildfires need to grow out of control. Once a Wood Framed house starts to burn, it is nearly impossible for Firefighters to control it. Wood Frame construction significantly contributes to the extreme wildfires & devastating fire tornadoes seen in the video above.
          </p>
          <p>
            When looking at photos of neighborhoods ravaged by an extreme wildfire, the odd thing you may notice is that all the houses have been reduced to ash, while trees, some naturally fire resistant, remain standing. This is clear evidence that wood framed homes are often the primary fuel source that a wildfire uses to become massive and unstoppable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently on MSNBC news, 9-15-20, a couple in Oroville CA was interviewed who lost their 2nd home in the past 2 years to a wildfire. Yes, their 2nd Home to a wildfire. They lost their 1st home in the 2018 Paradise wildfire and now their 2nd home in 2020. It’s hard to imagine someone losing 1 home to a wildfire, let alone 2.
          </p>
          <p>
            This begs the question, why are Architects still designing, and builders still building, wood framed houses and structures in High Fire Risk areas, especially for those who have already lost their home to a wildfire?
          </p>
          <p>
            It is somewhat puzzling when given the fact that it is possible to build true Fire Safe Homes given an architect’s inherent ingenuity and out of the box thinking. Of course, availability of materials and cost is always a factor. However, what is the cost of NOT building to resist extreme wildfires and fire tornadoes when literally thousands of structures annually continue to burn down? The losses add up to billions annually.
          </p>
          <p>
            While there are varying degrees of fire resistance ranging from resisting minor fires and embers to full Fire Proof structures, design standards must strive to create structures that can withstand the extreme heat caused by wildfires and flying debris caused by fire tornadoes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Challenges are many, especially when there is evidence of standard reinforced concrete failing when subject to extreme heat, even for just moderate amounts of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As many States are currently experiencing the devastation caused by extreme wildfires, their building codes and standards must change to require effective fire resistant features to protect property during natural disasters.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can look toward the State of Florida, for example, as they drastically changed their building codes in 2001, requiring design and construction of buildings to withstand Category 5 Hurricanes, especially in the High Velocity Hurricane Zone (Broward & Miami-Dade Counties). These standards even required windows and doors to resist wind borne debris impact from flying objects (tested with missiles traveling at 80 feet per second) that these hurricanes produce. Category 5 Hurricanes have sustained wind speeds greater than 157 mph with 3 second gusts up to 185 mph.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many thought that building to resist the threat of a powerful hurricane was not possible as the tremendous wind forces and flying debris created challenges for manufacturers to produce products that could withstand these elements. Initially, the cost for these products seemed high, however they are commonplace now and more affordable. In addition, homeowners save on their insurance premiums, so the actual cost is greatly minimized. Thankfully, Florida has achieved reliable Hurricane resistant buildings through strict codes and construction standards.

          <p>
            So, do you think homes can be designed and built to withstand Extreme Wildfires and Massive Fire Tornadoes, even when carrying debris with hurricane force winds? I think definitely yes!
          </p>
          <p>
            Hopefully, interest in building true Fire Safe / Fire Proof Homes, those that can withstand extreme heat and flying debris from Fire Tornadoes, will increase and become commonplace, so that families can feel safe no matter how extreme wildfires are.

            Robert is an Architect & Builder in South Florida, designing & building structures in the High Velocity Hurricane Zone, to resist Category 5 Hurricanes. For the past 2 years, he has focused his attention on developing designs for True Fire Safe Homes, ones that can resist powerful wildfires & fire tornadoes that are occurring in many states.
